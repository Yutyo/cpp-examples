### <a name="bmi_calculator"></a>BMI Calculator
Body mass index (BMI) is a value derived from the mass and height of a person. The BMI is defined as the body mass divided by the square of the body height.

This program calculates the BMI of a person by:
1. Asking them their height in metres (m)
2. Asking them their weight in kilograms (kg)
3. Calculating their BMI with the formula weight / (height * height).

### <a name="space_traveler"></a>Space Traveler
Someone is travelling from planet Earth to six potential other planets in our solar system.  This program requests the person's weight on planet Earth, and then calculates their weight on the other planets.

The program does this by:
1. Asking the person their weight on planet Earth
2. Asking the person which planet they want to travel
3. After receiving those information, it multiplies the person's weight with the gravitational force of that planet to calculate their weight on those planets.
